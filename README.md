# Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) Prediction in Indian sub-tropical climate conditions
BPH is the major sucking insect pest of the Rice causing significant economic losses
Statistical models relay on assumptions, where most of the insect pest data do not follow
While machine learning models are data driven
Therefore, data driven models are show more accuracy over the statistical models
Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with exogenous variables (SARIMAX) model, Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) Model and Long-Short Trem Memory (LSTM) Model were developed and compared for their accuracy.
